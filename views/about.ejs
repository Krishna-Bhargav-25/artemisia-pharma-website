    Over the years, we have supplied premium-grade pellets to <strong>Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories</strong> and several global export houses, 
    maintaining an unblemished track record — <strong>not a single quality remark or marketing complaint in two decades.</strong>

    <li><strong>Unmatched Consistency:</strong> 100% supply accuracy and documentation compliance.</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>🌍 Global Reach. Local Expertise.</h2>
  <p>
    Today, operating independently as <strong>Artemisia Pharma Lifelines Pvt. Ltd.</strong>, 
    we bridge the gap between <strong>WHO-GMP certified manufacturers</strong> and <strong>global pharmaceutical formulators.</strong>  
    We specialize in sourcing and trading compliant, high-quality products that strengthen your formulation pipeline and production reliability.
