  <h1>Combinations</h1>
  <p class="muted">
    At <strong>Artemisia Pharma Lifelines</strong>, our <strong>combination formulations</strong> include both 
    <em>multi-layered pellets</em> and <em>granule-based blends</em>, enabling flexible release profiles and improved therapeutic performance.  
    These combinations are ideal for complex oral dosage forms that require precise drug release timing or multiple APIs within a single formulation.

    Our pellet combinations are developed by layering compatible APIs or functional coatings on inert cores, enabling 
    controlled or targeted release patterns. They are suitable for <strong>SR, CR, DR, and IR hybrid formulations</strong>.
